## This function caches the result of a matrix inverse calculation so that subsequent calls to calculate the inverse don't actually require the full calculation

## This function produces a matrix object that has functions tagged to it. These functions include:
# a constructor (set), 
# a return-me function (set), 
# a set inverse function that uses the solve function to calculate the inverse, and
# a get inverse that returns m, which in this case, is the inverse calculation result.
# The function returns a list of functions which can be called later on matrices created via makeCacheMatrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}

## CacheSolve checks whether the specific object that we created with the above function has had its inverse calculated yet.
## If that calculation has happened already, it simply looks up the inverse using the getinverse function defined above.
## If it has not been calculated yet, then it goes ahead and uses the set inverse function defined above 
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
